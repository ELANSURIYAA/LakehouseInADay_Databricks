Description:   Review of Silver Layer Data Mapping for DC Health Meter Reports
=============================================

1. Executive Summary
This review evaluates the Silver Layer Data Mapping for DC Health Meter Reports, focusing on data consistency, transformation logic, validation rules, business requirements alignment, error handling, and compliance with Databricks and PySpark best practices.

2. Methodology
The review was conducted by analyzing the provided mapping documentation, inspecting transformation logic, validation rules, audit mechanisms, and business alignment. Each section was assessed for correctness (✅) and issues (❌).

3. Findings

3.1 Data Consistency
✅ All mapped fields from Bronze to Silver are clearly documented and consistently mapped.
✅ Column names and data types are preserved or transformed as required.
❌ No explicit mention of handling schema drift or unexpected data types.

3.2 Transformations
✅ Transformations are correctly applied as per business rules, including necessary calculations and data standardization.
✅ Intermediate transformations, joins, and aggregations are described and logically sequenced.
❌ Some transformation steps lack explicit error handling for edge cases.

3.3 Validation Rules
✅ Validation rules are defined for key fields (e.g., null checks, range checks, format validation).
✅ Data quality checks are implemented for critical columns.
❌ Coverage for all business-critical fields could be expanded; some rules are described but not implemented in code.

3.4 Compliance with Best Practices
✅ Mapping follows Databricks and PySpark best practices for performance and maintainability.
✅ Use of partitioning, caching, and efficient joins is noted.
❌ Some opportunities for optimization (e.g., broadcast joins, incremental loads) are not explicitly addressed.

3.5 Business Requirements Alignment
✅ Mapping logic aligns with documented business rules and reporting needs.
✅ All required fields for DC Health Meter Reports are present in the Silver layer.
❌ Minor gaps in documentation for certain business logic transformations.

3.6 Error Handling and Logging
✅ Audit table tracks metadata, including timestamps, statuses, and error logs.
✅ Error handling mechanisms are described for data transfer failures.
❌ Logging granularity could be improved for transformation errors and validation failures.

3.7 Effective Data Mapping
✅ All source tables and target tables are clearly identified.
✅ Mappings are correct and complete for the documented workflow.
❌ No lineage diagram or explicit mapping table for complex joins.

3.8 Data Quality
✅ High-quality data with minimal duplication or errors is expected based on validation rules.
✅ Null values and edge cases are considered in most transformations.
❌ Some edge cases (e.g., unexpected nulls, out-of-range values) are not fully documented.
